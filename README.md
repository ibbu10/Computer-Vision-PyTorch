# Facial Landmark Detection Using CNN

![](Pytorch_logo.png)

This is my work on project #1 on the Udacity nano degree of Computer Vision.

It is completely done in Pytorch, which is an advanced machine learning framework.

Data set used is Youtube's Face Database.

Please make sure you have conda installed in order to run all the code locally.
Also if needed refere to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf in order to understand why these hyper parameters were used.
Training on CPU might take up to 6 hours :)

Cheers!
